# Insight Analyst Task

The aim of this task is to test two broad skills important for Insight Analysts:  Analysis & Communication.

## Analysis
There are two datasets to be analysed, both of which will need to be downloaded from a public Github repository (https://github.com/pnuttbutter/insight_analyst_task).  Please sign up to Github if you haven't previously done so.  A description of each dataset is also available within this repository.

The analysis component may require checking & cleaning the data where data quality issues have been identified.  In order to get the most from the datasets they will need to be combined or linked together in some way.

There is no specific goal for the analysis, only to investigate and identify anything that you would consider to be interesting.

Pay attention to the steps you take in the collection & analysis of the data, as how you approach this task is as important as the insights that you uncover.

## Communication
The second part of the task is to communicate the insights that you have found in the datasets.  

This can be in any format you choose, just make sure to support the insights with the data in some way.

The main focus is to try to tell a story using the data as succinctly as possible.  Also consider what else you could do with the data, and what resources you'd need to do this.

## Tools
The task is tool-agnostic, so feel free to use any applications/languages that you are comfortable with.  There are many open source & free to use applications out there, below is a brief list:

* Tableau Public - https://public.tableau.com/s/
* Google Sheets - https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/
* OpenOffice - https://www.openoffice.org/
* MySQL - https://www.oracle.com/mysql/index.html
* MS SQL Server - https://www.microsoft.com/Web/platform/database.aspx
